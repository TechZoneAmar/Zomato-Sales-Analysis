## üîß How to Reproduce (Excel - Step by Step)

1. **Open the data**
   - Open `zomato_orders.csv` in Excel or import the raw workbook.

2. **Data preparation**
   - Ensure dates are real Excel dates.  
     `Order_Date` ‚Üí Format: `Date`
   - Add helper columns:
     - `Order_Month` ‚Üí `=TEXT([@Order_Date], "YYYY-MM")`
     - `Order_Week` ‚Üí `=TEXT([@Order_Date],"YYYY-WW")` (optional)

3. **Create Table**
   - Select your data ‚Üí `Insert` ‚Üí `Table` (helps pivot auto-refresh and slicer linking).

4. **Pivot Tables**
   - Insert multiple Pivot Tables on a new sheet:
     - Cuisine vs Count of Order_ID (Order Count)
     - Cuisine vs Average of Order_Amount (Avg Order Value)
     - Order_Month vs Count of Order_ID and Avg of Order_Amount (trends)
     - Payment_Method vs Sum of Order_Amount (payment contribution)
     - Restaurant_Name vs Sum of Order_Amount (Top restaurants)
     - Rating vs Count of Order_ID (ratings distribution)
     - Is_Discount_Applied vs Avg Order_Amount & Avg Rating

5. **Pivot Charts**
   - Convert Pivot Tables to charts:
     - Bar/Column charts for cuisine/restaurant comparisons
     - Line chart for monthly trends (Orders & Avg amount ‚Äî secondary axis if needed)
     - Pie/Donut chart for Ratings and Payment Method shares
     - Scatter plot for Delivery_Time vs Rating (data chart, not pivot)

6. **Add Slicers & Timeline**
   - `PivotTable Analyze` ‚Üí `Insert Slicer` for `Cuisine`, `Payment_Method`, `Restaurant_Name`, `Is_Discount_Applied`.
   - `Insert Timeline` for `Order_Date`.
   - Connect slicers/timeline to all pivot tables (Report Connections).

7. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Create `Dashboard` sheet and place:
     - Top-left: Project title and screenshot/logo
     - Top-right: KPIs (Total Orders, Total Revenue, Avg Rating, Avg Delivery Time) using small pivot tables
     - Middle: Main charts (Cuisine, Top 10 restaurants, Ratings, Payment Methods)
     - Bottom: Trend chart (Monthly Orders & Avg Amount) and scatter (Delivery vs Rating)
     - Place slicers/timeline at the top for clear interaction

8. **Formatting & UX**
   - Use consistent fonts, bold chart titles, add data labels where helpful.
   - Ensure slicers are sized uniformly and aligned.
   - Freeze panes and hide intermediate pivot sheets if sharing the workbook.

## üìà Visualizations & KPIs
- KPI Cards: Total Orders, Total Revenue, Average Order Amount, Average Rating, Average Delivery Time.
- Visuals:
  - Cuisine-wise Order Count (Bar)
  - Cuisine-wise Avg Order Value (Bar)
  - Top 10 Restaurants by Revenue (Bar)
  - Monthly Orders & Avg Order Amount (Line chart with dual axis)
  - Ratings Distribution (Pie chart)
  - Payment Method Contribution (Pie chart)
  - Delivery Time vs Rating (Scatter plot)

---

## üìù Key Insights (summary)
- Indian, Italian, and American cuisines lead order volume.
- Italian cuisine shows the highest average order value.
- A small set of restaurants contributes disproportionately to revenue (top 10).
- Ratings distribution suggests opportunities to improve customer experience.
- Most customers use digital payment methods (UPI, Debit/Credit).

---

## üí° Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing on high-demand, high-value cuisines (Indian & Italian).
- Negotiate exclusive deals with top-performing restaurants.
- Investigate low-rating orders for operational improvements (delivery times, packaging).
- Promote digital payments with small incentives and cashback.

---

## üîÅ How to Update Data
1. Replace `data/zomato_orders.csv` with a new file (same column structure).
2. Open the Excel workbook and click `Data` ‚Üí `Refresh All` (pivots and slicers will update).
3. If table range changed, convert to Table and reconnect pivots/slicers as needed.
